## About Program
This is a solver program of a puzzle called 15-puzzle. It is basically a game to achieve particular goal state from the given state. Further information about 15-puzzle can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle

This solver uses an algorithm strategy called branch and bound to optimally find the solution path. It has feature to visualize the path as well as the heuristics strategy and analysis. The approximate cost in this B&B techniques is determined by the number of tiles that are not in the right position relative to the goal state.
